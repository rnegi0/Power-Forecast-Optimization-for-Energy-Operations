# Project Overview

**What is this project about?**  This project leverages real-world sensor data from a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) to predict net energy output (PE) using various environmental factors. The goal is to help optimize energy generation, enhance efficiency, and support sustainable resource management.

**Why is it important?** Energy production efficiency is crucial for reducing fuel consumption and lowering environmental impact. Predicting the power output allows plant operators to make better decisions, avoid under/overproduction, and reduce operational costs.

**So what?** By developing a robust machine learning model (XGBoost), we demonstrate how data science can directly support energy optimization, sustainability goals, and cost-effective production planning.

### Business Context
Power generation companies operate in a highly cost-sensitive and efficiency-driven environment. The Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) is designed to generate power using both gas and steam turbines, making it more efficient than conventional methods. However, fluctuating environmental conditions such as temperature, ambient pressure, humidity, and exhaust vacuum can significantly impact energy production.

# Insight Deep Dive
**Environmental parameters**
- **What we are looking:** The relationship between output Energy across all the environmental parameters
- **Insights:** Ambient Temperature (AT) usually has a strong negative correlation with Power Output.

**Pairplots for all Environmental parameters**

- **what are we looking:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing relationships within a dataset, Understanding Pairwise Relationships, Identifying Correlations and Patterns and Comparing Groups within
  Data.
- **Insights:** Relationships Between Variables: There seems to be negative correlation between AT (Ambient Temperature) and PE (Power Output), which makes sense as higher temperatures might reduce efficiency in energy production. V (Exhaust Vacuum) shows a relatively strong positive correlation with PE. AP (Ambient Pressure) and RH (Relative Humidity) appear to have weaker relationships with PE.

**Temperature and Power Output Trend**
- **What we are looking:** As temperature increases, power output tends to decrease — likely due to thermodynamic efficiency loss.
- **Insights:** Higher temperatures (AT) negatively affect the power output (PE). This is due to reduced efficiency in thermal energy conversion as the ambient temperature increases.
![Screenshot (346)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d9c4a7e-ccc1-40ef-9e35-49d48bc430ea)

**Exhaust Vacuum and Power Output Trend**
- **What we are looking:** The relationship between vacuum level (condenser pressure) and turbine power output/efficiency is negatively correlated—but in a way that improves performance as vacuum increases.
- **Insight:** Vacuum (V) has a strong negative correlation with PE. As vacuum increases, the turbines operate more efficiently, leading to higher power output. While vacuum and condenser pressure are inversely related, power output increases with higher vacuum (up to an optimal point). So, the useful effect is positive, but the physical correlation is negative.

**Ambient Pressure vs. Power Output**
- **What we are looking:** Positive correlation as Higher ambient pressure improves both gas and steam turbine performance in a CCPP.
- **Insights:** Ambient pressure (AP) shows a moderate positive correlation with PE. Higher pressures improve combustion efficiency in power plants, resulting in better energy conversion.

## Summary 
- Temperature (AT) has the strongest negative correlation with power output. Higher temperatures reduce energy efficiency.
- Exhaust Vacuum (V) also shows a strong inverse relation with PE.
- Pressure (AP) and Humidity (RH) have moderate effects but contribute to overall accuracy when retained.
